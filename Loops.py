Accessing the data in a List we can use a for loop:
    e.g. magicians = ['Phoenix','Sultan','Ndhlovu']
         for value in variable:
             print(value)
"""

cars = ['Royce','Range','BMW','Urus']
for car in cars:
    print(f'{car.title()}, is the car i plan to drive before 35')
"""

A for loop repeats the task for each item in the loop.
A for loop gives the advantage of summarizing an operation performed on a dataset
